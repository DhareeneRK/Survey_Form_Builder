## Date:

## AIM
To create a Survey Form Builder using ReactJS..

## ALGORITHM
### STEP 1 Initialize States
mode ← 'build' (default mode)

questions ← [] (holds all survey questions)

currentQuestion ← { text: '', type: 'text', options: '' } (holds input while building)

editingIndex ← null (tracks which question is being edited)

responses ← {} (user responses to survey)

submitted ← false (indicates whether survey was submitted)

### STEP 2 Switch Modes
Toggle mode between 'build' and 'fill' when the toggle button is clicked.

Reset submitted to false when entering Fill Mode.

### STEP 3 Build Mode Logic
#### a. Add/Update Question
If currentQuestion.text is not empty:

If type is "radio" or "checkbox", split currentQuestion.options by commas → optionsArray.

Construct a questionObject:

If editingIndex is not null, replace question at that index.

Else, push questionObject into questions.

Reset currentQuestion and editingIndex.

#### b. Edit Question
Set currentQuestion to the selected question’s data.

Set editingIndex to the question’s index.

#### c. Delete Question
Remove the selected question from questions.

### STEP 4 Fill Mode Logic
#### a. Render Form
For each question in questions:

If type is "text", render a text input.

If type is "radio", render radio buttons for each option.

If type is "checkbox", render checkboxes.

#### b. Capture Responses
On input change:

For "text" and "radio", update responses[index] = value.

For "checkbox":

If option exists in responses[index], remove it.

Else, add it to the array.

### STEP 5 Submit Form
When user clicks "Submit":

Set submitted = true.

Display a summary using the questions and responses.

### STEP 6 Display Summary
Iterate over questions.

Display the response from responses[i] for each question:

If it's an array, join it with commas.

If empty, show "No response".
